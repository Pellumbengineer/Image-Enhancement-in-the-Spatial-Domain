# Image-Enhancement-in-the-Spatial-Domain

At first we have two images. One of the images has noise and is dark so we have to do enhancement. 
The other image i used to apply different point processing techniques.

## This is the original image (Input).

 ## At this image i applied inverse intensity method.

## At this one i applied arithmetic operation method.

## At this one i applied histogram equalization method.

## This is the noisy and dark image.

## This is the output after filtering

So to filter this image from noisy i applied the median filter which is the ideal one for salt and pepper noisy.
To make it brighter i used histogram equalization.After these two methods the imge was quit good but it was still 
blurred. So i used also a sharpening filter.
